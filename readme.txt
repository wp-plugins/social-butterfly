== Description ==

[Social Butterfly](http://www.website101.net/social-butterfly-sleek-social-media-sharing-plugin-for-wordpress/) is a sleek and attractive social media sharing plugin for WordPress, offering users a unique, compact and enticing way to share your content. The plugin is lightweight, secure, and allows for easy integration above and below content on all posts (customizable in plugin settings) as well as simple post override settings (ex: show or hide social butterfly on an individual post).

**Now with Pinterest**

**New Feature: Custom Colors** Easily customize colors to match your site.

**Demo & Detailed Instructions:** [visit plugin homepage](http://www.website101.net/social-butterfly-sleek-social-media-sharing-plugin-for-wordpress/).

**Upcoming Features:**
Social Butterfly has just emerged from its cacoon. We're working hard on adding new and exciting features including:

* **Resizable.** Make social butterfly bigger for more impact.
* **Support for pages.** Include Social Butterfly on pages as well as posts.
* **More Networks!** Tell us which networks you want to see.
* **Suggest a feature.** Let us know what you'd like to see in Social Butterfly.

== Installation ==
**Full Instructions with Screenshots available on [plugin
homepage](http://www.website101.net/social-butterfly-sleek-social-media-sharing-plugin-for-wordpress/).**

1. Download plugin from WordPress Plugins Directory or directly through your WordPress Dashboard (Plugins menu > Add New).
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Navigate to the plugin settings page (Settings > Social Butterfly or the Settings link on the plugins admin page under the Social Butterfly plugin).
1. Select the networks you would like to include (currently supports Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn).
1. Select whether to include Social Butterfly automatically on all posts above the content, below the content, or in both places.

*Note: Social Butterfly allows you to override these default display settings on individual post edit pages. Selecting the "Override all individual post settings with these new settings" option here will override all custom post settings. If you want to maintain your existing post override settings (for example, to hide Social Butterfly on certain posts) then do *not select this option.

**Post Override Settings**

Let's say you want to include the plugin on all your posts except for a couple. Maybe your "Terms of Use" is a post and you don't really want to include Social Butterfly on this post. The best way to go about this is would be set your default options on the plugin settings page to include Social Butterfly on all posts, then override this setting on the individual posts where you don't want Social Butterfly to be included.

1. Navigate to the edit page of the post.
1. In the Social Butterfly settings, select "Override default settings on this post". Checking this box will enable the options below.
1. Set Social Butterfly to not show on this particular post (uncheck).
1. Update your post. That's all!
